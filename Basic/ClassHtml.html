The number differs widely due to lack of research on the counts and the fact that these rivers changes flow in time and season. Historical sources state about 700 to 800[5] rivers but most of them have dried out or are extinct due to lack of attention and pollution. The numbers also differ because the same rivers may change names in different regions and through history.
